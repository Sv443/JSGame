# JSGame
## A game development library for vanilla JavaScript that offers many features and classes that make game developing in JS easier
  
  
## This library is in the process of being re-written
I have learned many things since I made this library and am now working on improving it with my gained skills.  
The library will now make use of ES6 classes, which makes usage way easier.  
Also I will make it much more stable now by (for example) cleaning up the code a bit or removing the unused raycasting class.  

## Version 0.2.0 will *NOT* be backwards-compatible with version 0.1.0!
